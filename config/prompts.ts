    Decisions at the crossroads: as Parliament votes on the contentious Rwanda migrant relocation bill, the nation watches with bated breath. Reports reveal potential replicas with countries like Armenia hanging in the balance, resting on Rwanda's outcome.

    Amendments from the House of Lords have been met with government pushback, all under the scrutiny of a critical public eye.
